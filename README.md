# Assignment3
A Java code for building an app using Arrays
Build an app that randomly creates a 10 by 10 grid of 0s and 1s where the 0s represent open spaces
and 1s represent blocked spaces (like we did in class), and then see if user can navigate from position
0,0 to where either the first index or second index equal 9 w/o hitting a 1. In other words the user
must move clear across the grid without hitting a 1 or the game is over.
